# AlphaDirectory
Visual directory of all unique websites &amp; web apps on SAFE Network Alpha

View it live here (use Launcher too): <a href="http://bit.do/AlphaDirectory">bit.do/AlphaDirectory</a>

Looks like Yvette has been too busy to update the directory, so I'm helping :)

ToDo:
 - ADD SAFENET LINK WHEN READY
 - create safe-js functions for users to submit their own links & photos
 - create ways for the site to automatically push this data to the page (shared SD objects?)
 
Thanks! Enjoy!
